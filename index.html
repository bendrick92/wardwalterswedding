                    <p>Ben and I met during my first days as a fresman at UW-L.  Ben signed up for astronomy because he’s <em>truly</em> interested in stars and space. I enrolled in astronomy because it’s a science class that involves less blood than biology and less math than chemistry.</p>
                    <p>Ben was the smart guy that sat in front of me and helped me with (basically did) my homework. After one of our first exams, Ben waited for me outside the lecture hall until I finished the test. When I opened the doors, I saw him standing there and instantly felt so much excitement and was flattered that he thought to wait for me, and I instantly developed a monster crush on him.</p>
                    <p>We furthered our friendship through a leadership program at school, but when fall semester was over, he decided to quit the program to focus on school and his other job. I remember feeling completely disappointed, almost like we were breaking up, and would never see each other again! At that point I knew I needed to keep seeing and spending time with him, so I asked him if he’d like to grab lunch with me sometime. He said yes!</p>
                    <p>That year our relationship grew and we became great friends. We kept in touch over the summer, and returned to school in the fall.  However, I was secretly hoping we would soon be more than “just friends”. One night we were at the river sitting on a bench overlooking the sunset, it was so beautiful and quiet, we were having a great conversation. I thought "This would be a perfect time for him to officially ask me to be his girlfriend!". However, that conversation didn’t happen that night. Instead Ben asked me to be his girlfriend on a dorm room futon... I loved to give him a hard time about missing that perfect opportunity that evening on that bench!</p>
                    <h4 class="title is-6 has-small-margin-after">The Proposal</h4>
                    <p>I thought that day would be spent with Hayley and her fiancé Nick in LaCrosse. We would start in Rochester and take a detour at Elmaro winery, and then make our way to LaCrosse to some of our favorite college bars and hangouts. The day was so beautiful and bright...and HOT! Once we made our way to the Mississippi River for drinks at the Water Front, Hayley said she forgot her phone in the car, and was going with Nick to get it. Ben suggested we walk to the restaurant and wait for them inside because of the heat. When we passed THE bench that we joked about for so long, he said we should sit down and wait outside instead.  After we sat, he started saying all of these really sweet things and got down on one knee and asked me to marry him! Maybe it was all of the beverages I had or maybe it was the heat...but I was <em>so</em> shocked I couldn’t believe it. Of course I said yes!</p>
                    <p>Just a minute after I said yes he said "Well...there’s more...look over there!". When I did, my mom, cousins, and Hayley and Nick came running over to celebrate with us. It was the best day ever and I can’t believe he pulled off such a big surprise!</p>

                    <h4 class="title is-6 has-small-margin-after">How We Met</h4>
                    <p>Over the last seven years, it's hard to believe how far Ali and I have come!  It all started at Camp Pepin as part of a leadership retreat for UW-L.</p>
                    <p>That weekend was the first chance I got to know Ali outside of school, and I quickly came to realize not only was she super cute, we shared the same sense of humor!  From that moment on I knew that I wanted to make her laugh any and every opportunity I got.</p>
                    <p>When we got back to school I remember telling my roommate Sam about "this girl on the trip".  I couldn't stop thinking about her!  You can imagine my surprise come Monday when I found out she had been sitting behind me in our Astronomy class for weeks!  Over the next few months our friendship continued to grow, but I knew that we were quickly becoming more than just friends.  Unfortunately I ended up quitting the school leadership program to pursue a job with Residence Life.  I remember telling the group over a cereal breakfast, and vividly recall Ali's expression of surprise/frustration/disbelief.  It was heartbreaking, but we kept in touch through regular lunch "dates" on campus.</p>
                    <p>A few more months passed and Ali took a position as a Resident Assistant - a natural fit for her charismatic personality!  However, between our jobs and school, finding time together became harder and harder.  I knew I had to tell Ali how I felt about her or I might never get the chance!</p>
                    <p>After missing an opportunity for the "perfect moment" by the riverside in La Crosse (in hindsight, it was pretty obvious...), I took a chance and told her how I felt one night while we were hanging out in her room watching Finding Nemo.  She said she felt the same way and we started officially dating!</p>
                    <p>Over the next few years we went through eight moves, three cities, and adopted two cats together.  We had our fair share of challenges but always came out of it together, albeit with two sassy felines by our sides.  While it was hard to imagine things changing, I spent years dreaming of the day when I could ask her to marry me.  The logistics would be difficult, as anyone who knows Ali will agree - she's damn good at sniffing out secrets/presents...</p>
                    <h4 class="title is-6 has-small-margin-after">The Proposal</h4>
                    <p>I recruited her Mom, cousins, and best friend Hayley to help me out.  I knew I had to make up for all those years earlier when I had missed the opportunity of a lifetime on that bench on the riverside in La Crosse, and so a devious plan was formed!  Hayley, her fiance Nick, Ali and I would spend the day in the La Crosse area visiting our favorite wineries, bars, and restaurants while her Mom and cousins would sneak over from Milwaukee and meet us by the river.  As we arrived in La Crosse, I remember thinking that either A) the wine was really starting to get to me, or B) I was getting reallll nervous.  I knew Ali didn't suspect anything because she was having the time of her life!</p>
                    <p>We got to the riverside and the plan was set in motion - Hayley and Nick "ran back to their car" to get their phones they had conveniently "forgotten".  I took Ali's hand and suggested we kept walking to get out of the heat, conveniently passing by <em>the</em> bench.  I said "Remember this old thing?" asking her to sit.  I told her how much I'd come to love her and our lives together, got down on one knee, and popped the big question!  In her heat-induced delrium, she forgot to say "Yes" right away, but I got it out of her eventually!  Then her family and friends (who had been hiding close by on the riverwalk) popped up and ran over to congratulate us.  I've never seen a greater mixture of confusion, love, and happiness from a human being before!</p>
